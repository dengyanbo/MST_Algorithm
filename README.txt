How to run the java program:
1)in the root folder, there are two folders: src & lib, 
and there are two subfolders of src: mst & graphs
in mst/, there are five *.java files which are the source files
in graph/, there are several *.txt files which are the input graph files I generated

2)import all three *.jar files in the lib/ as the library, these files are used to display the graphs

3)in the src/mst/Main.java, set the variable "filePath" to the path of src/graphs/ in your system

4)if you want to generate new graphs, set the variable "generate" into true; if you just want to use the graphs in graphs/, set it to false

5)run the src/mst/Main.java and you can get all original graphs, MSTs generated by Prim's, Kruskal's, and Boruvka's algorithm
